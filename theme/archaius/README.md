Getting Starting
----------------

Archaius uses jQuery as a javascript framework and several jQuery plugins as well:

* A modified version of [responsiveslides](https://github.com/dmuneras/ResponsiveSlides.js)
* VelocityJS
* Waypoints
* Modernizr 

I have been using [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) to create CSS stylesheets.


If you want to modify the stylesheets, or jquery plugins, you should use Grunt. I configured a Gruntfile.js, so, you only need to install it and use it. Take a look of this
website if you have any problem installing Grunt => [Getting Starting](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)

After read the Grunt getting starting, you only have to run the Grunt command in the root
directory of archaius.

```javascript

grunt

```
After this any change you do in jQuery plugins or LESS source will be reflected in your CSS
and Javascript.

If you want to modify the archaius YUI module, yout have to install YUI shifter:

npm install shifter@0.4.6 -g

take a look to this: [YUI shifter docs in Moodle](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/YUI/Shifter)
