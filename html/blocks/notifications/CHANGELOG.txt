	Version - 1.3.x Presets + Bugfixes
==========================================================================================

Added user presets for channel preferences
    
    Added presets for user channel preferences. These presets can be
    defined globally and on course level. They are the default preference
    for the users. Every user can define his/her preference and overwrite
    the default settings. The user preferences have precedence over the
    default ones.

RSS shortname url param as setting
    
    Added shortname as setting in the global and course configuration
    panel.
    Now is possible to set the shortname as RSS url parameter directly
    from the configuration panel.

Check the RSS by using the shortname as url option
    
    Other than id now is possible to specify the shortname of the
    course by passing the options shortname=Course_Shortname

BUGFIXES:
    Conditional activities support fixed
    
		The conditional activities were not managed correctly.
		Now all the conditional activities which are set to be
		invisible until the condition is matched are ignored.
		Once the condition is matched the activity/resource is
		treated as new and is notified through available channels.


==========================================================================================
	Version 1.2; merge BUGFIX; documentation updated
==========================================================================================

BUGFIX:
- The Italian translation was missing in the last merge.

- The css selectors in the javascript functions were not adapted
to the new block name. So the user preferences ui was broken.

- The Course.php class had die() statements in two functions
instead of the return null; statements.
The null value was supposed to be returned so the die() statements
have been removed.

UPDATES:
- The README.txt and UPGRADE.txt have been updated.

NOTE:
- This commit brokes the backward compatibility so the major version
release is needed. That's why this is now the 1.2 version.

==========================================================================================
	Several bugfixes for new version: 1.0.3
==========================================================================================
	
Bugfix: Courses without teachers have broken RSS
	--
	Courses without teachers used to be a problem because of
	the missing email fields inside RSS file. When the course
	has no enrolled teachers a dummy email account is used.
	--

Bugfix: Deletion of invisible modules is notified
	--
	This version of the plugin ignores invisible modules during
	the course scansion. If a registered but invisible module is
	deleted than the deletion is still notified. This is just a
	matter of consistency because the addition of the module
	has been notified before.
	--

Bugfix: The order in the RSS entries is messy.
	--
	This was due to the initial logging policy. Every module had
	one entry in the log. Now every action is a different entry
	in the log table.
	--

Bugfix: Email; deleted entries have a link which is obviously broken
	--
	No links for deleted entries anymore. The modules doesn't exist
	so having a link is just pointless.
