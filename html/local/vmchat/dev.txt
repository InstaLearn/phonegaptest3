Vmchat for footer
----------------

Below code is not required. This is just for reference:- 

 To run this plugin some html code requires that get added automatically during installation.
 In case if that code is missing in Moodle we can easily achieve this through interface. 
 In  Additional HTML(moodle/admin/settings.php?section=additionalhtml) page add the below code:- 

*  Within HEAD 
<!-- fcStart --><script language="JavaScript"> var wwwroot="http://localhost/moodle/";</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://localhost/moodle/local/vmchat/bundle/chat/bundle/jquery/jquery-1.11.0.min.js">
</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://localhost/moodle/local/vmchat/bundle/chat/bundle/jquery/jquery-ui.min.js">
</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://localhost/moodle/local/vmchat/index.js"></script><!-- fcEnd -->  

 Note:- Replace this url "http://localhost/moodle" with your site url.

 * Before BODY is closed 
    <div id="stickycontainer"></div><!-- move page up from bottom to display bottom content -->
